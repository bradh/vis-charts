<div class="textHTMLContent">The ones we marked in blue are on our todo list but if someone wants to pick them up for us that would be great! Once we start working on a feature, we'll remove it from this list.
    The issues marked in green are being worked on by the community and link to their forked version. Finally, the ones in black are not on our immediate todo list but would be great if someone added them.</div>
